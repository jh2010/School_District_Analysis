# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to re-run the school district analysis because the school detected evidence of academic dishonesty in the students_complete.csv file. Thomas High School has been identified as the source of the academic dishonesty.  The math and reading scores for the ninth grade will be removed and replaced with NaNs. Also, the analysis will be repeated once the fruadulent math and reading scores have been removed.

A written explaination will be given below with a description of how the changes affected the overall analysis.
